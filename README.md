### HoDoKu

This HoDoKu is my modifications to hobiwan's 2.2.0 Hodoku.jar [HoDoKu - v2.2.0 (Build 116)] released 2012-07-29.

### Release notes

HoDoKu is a solver/generator/trainer/analyzer for standard sudoku. It is written in Java/Swing and should therefore run on any platform supported by Java (tested on Windows and Linux - Ubuntu/GTK+-LAF). Since it is written in Java the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6 or higher must be installed on your computer before you can run HoDoKu. The JRE can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Available languages: English and german

For all Windows versions hodoku.exe is the preferred program version. For all other operating systems hodoku.jar has to be used. HoDoKu uses rather a lot of memory (especially if you use the "Find all available steps" feature). The recommended way to run HoDoKu is:
```
java -Xmx256m -jar hodoku.jar
```
Note: the parameter "-Xmx" is specific to the JRE provided by Oracle. If you use a different JRE, please look up the correct parameter for setting the maximum heap size at startup.
